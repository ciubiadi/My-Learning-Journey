# My-Learning-Journey - React Full Stack Events App
In this app I did practice React Router.

## What I have practiced 
The backend part of the app was provided by the trainer and I played a little bit only with the route of events. ( __React/Udemy-React-Complete-Guide/FullStackJS/backend/routes/events.js_ )
The main Structure of the React App splits into pages(that are the direct rendered pages with routes) and components used for the pages( like the EventForm.js which is reusable, the EventsList.js which renders the list of events on Events.js page, and so on).

With this project I improved myhands on experience with the core React hooks such as **useEffect**, **useReducer**, **useState**.
Also, I did practice the routing and navigation using hooks such as **useRouter**, **useNavigation**, **useActionData**, **useLoaderData** and **useRouteLoaderData**. Nevertheless, I also practiced the management of the bridge between frontend and backend, more exactly handling http requests (such as fetching data from url api);   
Furthermore, I practiced handling form data.

### How to use it
The instructions of how to use the backend and frontend app are in _React/Udemy-React-Complete-Guide/FullStackJS/how-to-use.txt_ .  

### Exercises
In _React/Udemy-React-Complete-Guide/FullStackJS/frontend/exercise.txt_ I have some exercises that I resolved. Also, in each component I left documented everything I learned using new features of React.
