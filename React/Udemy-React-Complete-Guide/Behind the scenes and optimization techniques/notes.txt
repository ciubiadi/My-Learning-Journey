So React is a JS library for building user interfaces. We use components to effectively compose and 
update user interfaces. 
The ReactDOM is the interface to the web,  ReactJS doesn't know the web. ReactDOM is responsible for
what the user sees.

React compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and the React DOM will update the Real DOM after the comparisson. 
ReactDOM will not rerender the entire real DOM, it would not touch the existing things, it will only insert / render
the modified elements.
