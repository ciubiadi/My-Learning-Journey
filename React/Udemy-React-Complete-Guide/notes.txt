React has 1 main job : to focus on Render UI and React to the Userd Input
In other words, it Evcaluate & Render JSX, it manage States and Props


An Effect (or SideEffect) deals with anything else :
- It stores data in browser
- it sends HTTP Requests to backend servers
- set and manage timers
- not bring directly something to the screen
These tasks must happen outside the normal component evaluation

We can handle with the useEffect React Hook the side effects.

Inside the useEffect method, we will have :
- a function that should be executed 
after every component evaluation if the specified dependencies changed
- dependencies of this effect - the function only runs if the dependencies changed
syntax : useEffect(() => {}, [dependencies]);


If you want a useEffect to run only once you need to have an empty array for the dependencies parameter.

useEffect Summary: 
- if no dependencies parameter is empty than it will run only once
- The Cleanup function runs after the first run but before the state function as a whole runs (the effect function)
- the cleanup function will run when the component is removed

useEffect only runs AFTER the state was changed!!!

//// Reducers
useReducer helps with state management and is especially useful for more complex state
 
Sometimes you have more complex state - for example if it got multiple states, multiple ways of changing it
or dependecies to other states

useState vs useReducer
useState is :
- the main state management
- great for independend piece of state/data
- great if state updates are easy and limited to a few kinds of updates

useReducer is :
- great if you need "more power" and use more complex logic
- great if you have related piece of state/data
- can be helpful if you have more complex state updates

======================
///// Context API - React Context
One of the approaches for using Context is to separate Authentication for example, so we can move the entire login from App to AuthContext
for example

Context Limitations
- React Context is NOT optimized for high frequency changes
