Local State :
- state that belongs to a single component (ex: listening to user input in a input field)
- should be managed component-internal with useState() / useReducer()

Cross-Component State:
- State that affects multiuple components (ex: open/close state of a modal overlay)
- require prop chains

Aoo Wide State:
- State that affecets the entire app ( ex: User authentication status )
- require props chains


React Context vs Redux
Redux and React Context are state management systems for cross-component or app-wide state.

React Context disadvantages:
- complex setup/management ( I may end up using a lot of context providers nested )
- performance can be bad ( not optimise for high-frequency state chagnes )
